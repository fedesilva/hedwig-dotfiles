#  Notes on how I would like to make this dotfiles better
#

+ Find out how to determine the platform
  + set a variable before importing?

+ make subfolders 
  + OK shell
  + OK git
  + OK hg
  ...
  + top level should have symlinkable files ( bashrc, bash_profile, etc.
  
+ move vim to a git submodule

+ create a bin dir with a script to symlink stuff to $HOME

+ prepare things to migrate to zsh
